## About

Simple test of few RAML Python parsers. Tests simply try to parse a set of examples and report if parser returned an error.

A fine collection of RAML files can be composed each containing one/few RAML features to test those in isolation.

Uses [raml-tck](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-tck/tree/master/tests/raml-1.0) as a source of tests.

NOTE: If file name contains "invalid" parsing of it is expected to fail.

## Install & run

```sh

```

## Options

Parser:
```sh

```

Verbose output (prints errors) (defaults to `false`):
